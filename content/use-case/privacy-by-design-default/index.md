One of the software and security design principles is **privacy by design** and **privacy by default**.

**Privacy by design** stands that organizations should consider data protection issues as part of the design and implementation of systems, services, products, and business practices.

The GDPR requires you to integrate data protection concerns into every aspect of your processing activities. This approach is **data protection by design and by default**. It is a key element of the GDPRâ€™s risk-based approach and its focus on accountability, ie your ability to demonstrate how you are complying with its requirements.

Databunker from the initial project design was built as secure storage of personal records and be compliant with GDPR regulations.

## How this can help you?

You can easily turn your service or product to be **privacy by design** compliant if you will use Databunker in the backend of your product or service and continue to adhere to [personal data minimization](https://databunker.org/use-case/data-minimization/) and [avoid PII in logs](https://databunker.org/use-case/gdpr-compliant-logging/).
