One of the software and security design principles is **privacy by design** and **privacy by default**.

**Privacy by design** stands that organizations should consider data protection issues as part of the design and implementation of systems, services, products and business practices.

The GDPR requires you to integrate data protection concerns into every aspect of your processing activities. This approach is **data protection by design and by default**. It is a key element of the GDPRâ€™s risk-based approach and its focus on accountability, ie your ability to demonstrate how you are complying with its requirements.

Databunker from the initial design was built to store personal records and be compliant with most of GDPR articles.
