Some organizations can not instantly cancel a customer account on his request as the customer might be under a service contract. As a result, a custom approval flow is required.

Databunker support this requirement.

**Customer**Â operations like a change of personal records like name, email, or application information change, consent withdrawal or forget-me request can be automatically executed in the Databunker database or Admin/DPO request will be created instead to approve this request.

This can help large organizations with the DPO to approve user requests.

Databunker allows you to configure what operations can be self-service or what operations require Admin / DPO approval.
