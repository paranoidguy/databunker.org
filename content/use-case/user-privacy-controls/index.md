According to GDPR, if you want to send your customer SMS using 3rd party gateway,
you must show to your customer a detailed notification message that you will send
his phone number to a specific SMS gateway company and the customer needs to confirm this operation.

You need to store these confirmations and Data Bunker can do it for you.

Consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. From GDPR, Article 7, item 3:

* **The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time.**
* **It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.**

In Data Bunker:

* Your customers can log in to his Data Bunker account and view all consents he gave.
* Customer can also discharge consents and we will send you a notification message.
* Removing consent for a customer is as easy as granting it in the first place.
