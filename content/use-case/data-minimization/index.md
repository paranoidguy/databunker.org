When you clean up your databases from personal records (PII) and use the Datbunker token instead, you are minimizing the scope of personal information stored in other systems. In addition, wheni sharing your customers' data with 3rd parties, Data Bunker provides you with the purposefully built, time-bound "shareable identity" token.
