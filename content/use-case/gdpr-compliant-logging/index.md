When talking about Personal Identifiable Information (PII) we are talking about strong and weak user identifiers. A strong identity for example is a username or email address. Weak identity is an IP address, browser user agent, cookie, or session id. A combination of weak identifiers gives us a strong user identifier.

When saving log events, you can not simply save the customer IP address, browser user agent, or cookie id in the web server or cloud log as it makes your system, not GDPR compliant unless you do one of the following:
* Short log retention policy - log removal logs on a weekly or monthly bases.
* Encrypt all strong and week identities in the log files.
* Use session token generated by Databunker in your logs.

**What is so special about the Databunker session token?**

An alternative solution is to use Databunker to generate a special session token to save in the server logs files. Databunker provides you an API to retrieve session info out of Databunker without an additional password for a limited time. For example one month.
